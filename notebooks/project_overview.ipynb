    "- Spotify currently returns HTTP 403 on every `audio-features` request, so the live dataset excludes tempo/energy metrics; document this limitation explicitly.\n",
    "- The remaining signals (regional tags, label classification, popularity, follower reach) still cover the research questions on gatekeeping.\n",
    "- Future experiments: obtain a refreshed user token with the correct scopes for audio features, fold in Apple Music/YouTube comparisons, or extend the artist metadata CSV with manager labels / diaspora granularity."
